Note that this is not a stock ext in that
- Some resources are changed to match the green dSS color scheme
- The CSS colors all have their G and B components switched (of #RGB or #RRGGBB) to get from stock blue to the dSS scheme
  use these VIM regexps to do this

%s/#\(\x\)\(\x\)\(\x\)\(\X\)/#\1\3\2\4/g
%s/#\(\x\x\)\(\x\x\)\(\x\x\)\(\X\)/#\1\3\2\4/g

- The icons can be converted using the same trick with the help of gimp.
  Run this in the given path (note that the pics will be _OVERWRITTEN_)
